## HTML

### Question #1

What does it mean for an HTML tag to be "semantic"? Give an example of a short snippet of HTML written using semantic tags and non-semantic tags.

```text
"Semantic" is defined as "the function of words beyond their dictionary definition." So the HTML tag itself (e.g. header, p,) has a specific function within HTML beyond its dictionary definition.

HTML Semantic Tags: <div class = "biography"></div> (you could even shorten this to bio)

HTML Non-Semantic Tags: <div class = "blue"></div>
```

### Question #2

What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute? e.g:

```html
<img src='https://jesse.sh/img/me.jpg' alt='Jesse Shawl'/>
```

```text
Websites are not just seen with the eyes. They are also read with text-readers. So if someone who is blind is visiting your website, the text reader would say "Jesse Shawl" instead of reciting the image link. Hearing "Jesse Shawl" would make more sense than hearing a URL. Also, alt tags can be useful for SEO purposes.
```

### Question #3

What is the purpose of the `<head></head>` tag in HTML?

```text
The head is where markups that are not "seen" on the page, but still affect the page, go. For example, you link you CSS and JS files to your HTML file in the <head></head>.
```

## CSS

### Question #4

In the spaces below, write the CSS property that best matches the given description.

The choices are `border`, `outline`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will leave two spaces blank.

Your Answer:

```text
margin: Defines the distance between an element's border and adjacent elements' borders.
border: Inserts a "wall" around an element.
padding: Defines the distance between an element's content and its border.
___: Defines the width of an element.
outline: Overlays a "wall" on top of an element.
___: Defines the distance between the center of an element and the center of the adjacent element.
```

### Question #5

What does the following selector do?  `ul.dropdown > li`?

Select 1:
```
[X] Selects all li's which are directly inside a ul of class dropdown (children)
[] Selects all li's which are anywhere inside a ul of class dropdown (any descendant)
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, as well as the children elements that are li's
[] Selects all ul's of class dropdown, only if their children are exclusively li's
```

### Question #6

Identify the three places CSS can go, and rank them in terms of specificity:

```text
1.
2.
3.
```

## Git
